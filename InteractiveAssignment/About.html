        <h2>Information about the app</h2>
        <p>On the Home page there is the welcoming message that greed the user to the website.
            There are few information about what the user can do in the website.
            I used a slideshow container to showcase the featured artists taken inspiration from
            <a href="https://codepen.io/mayurbirle/details/NvXKPq/">https://codepen.io/mayurbirle/details/NvXKPq/ </a>
            on how to do it but did it my way in the end.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I used collapsable panels to hide and display the Subscription levels with rotating icon to indicate to the user when it is collepsed or not.
            For the collapsable panels i took inspiration from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp</a>
            but i implemented it without javascript only css using the :checked~ selector. The triangle icon provided was made by me in paint.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            For the Featured Artist page i completed the requirements of the company. My paragraph is justified, the pictures have borders around them and there are titles under the images.
            The most challenging thing was the way to place the images. I got inspiration from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As for the Music List page i added extra navigation on the top.
            I combined the knowledge to make a collapsable panel with a list and crated a menu that has links/anchors to specific IDs in the page.
            I also included a search bar without functionality.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I was planing to make each genre have collapsable content but it would make the use of the extra menu on the top not necessary.
            Thus i made the genres instead into table but kept the checkboxes and labels to have the option to include it in the future.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For the Album details page I list the tracks of the album and use the audio HTML tag to provide the playback functionality.
            I also profited an mp3 to play that i recorded my self, thus it does not violate any copyright law.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The logo of the company is present in every page. The colour code #DB53FB is used in all the pages as well and the font family is Verdana with a fallback on
            Helvetica (they are both sans-serif typeface). Each page contains a navigation bar that links to other pages.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For the navigation bar i got inspiration from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp</a>
            but i changed it to fit my needs. I also made it fixed to the bottom of the website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Each page has a dummy div that pushes the navigation bar with margin down because is fixed.
            The icon in that div is taken from <a href="https://www.pinclipart.com/pindetail/iTTJixi_free-png-colorful-music-note-png-png-image/">https://www.pinclipart.com/pindetail/iTTJixi_free-png-colorful-music-note-png-png-image/</a>
            The icon  provided is free for use, no attribution required and thus does not violate copyright.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I used colors that contrast decent together and provide readable text with different kinds of backgrounds.
            Mostly black, white, colour code #DB53FB is used consistently trough the application.
        </p>
